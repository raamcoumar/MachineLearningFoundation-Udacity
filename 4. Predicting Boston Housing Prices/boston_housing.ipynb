    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "It helps a lot when we’re struggling with the model selection problem. As we knew, selecting the algorithm parameters, known as hyperparameters to distinguish them from the parameters that are adjusted within the machine learning algorithm. To migrate this problem, we can use Grid Search to specify a grid of any number of parameters and parameter values to traverse. It will train the classifier for each combination and obtain a cross-validation accuracy to evaluate each one. For example, we can use Grid Search to adjust C and gamma parameters at the same time in SVC, and further we obtain a better combination of C and gamma."

    "KFold divides all the samples in k groups of samples of equal sizes and is slightly simpler that Grid Search. The prediction function is learned using k - 1 folds, and the fold left out is used for test, i.e. K-Fold Cross Validation is used to validate our model through generating different combinations of the data we already have. For example, if we have 100 samples, we can train our model on the first 90, and test on the last 10. Then we could train on samples 1-80 & 90-100, and test on samples 80-90. Then repeat.\n",
    "Actually, we need both Grid Search and K-Fold CV, because we not only need to decide the size of train/test subset but also need to determine which combination of parameters of the chosen model would perfectly perform. As a result, it could be go wrong if we do only grid search but cv."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

I believe that the features provided to predict the house prices aren't enough, we could insert a bunch of other interesting features to predict the house values, but if we stop to think about that more features means more data, it will be very difficult to predict at some time, due to the amount of data. So, my bet is don't increase the number of features but instead of it change them to more relevant ones. The model isn't robust enough to make consistent predictions, we have $70k of variability in the price of the houses when the sensitivity test was runned showing that the model isn't sufficiently robust to predict new data. The data collected from Boston doesn't represents a rural city, instead of it, represents a bigger, urbanized and modern city, so those data isn't applicable for a rural city."
