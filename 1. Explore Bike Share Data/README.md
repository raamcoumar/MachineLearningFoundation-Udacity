This is a part of Udacity's 'Machine Learning Foundation' - NanoDegree Program.

In this project, we will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. We will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. 
This data is used all over the place in data science, including some visualizations (check this video out for example: https://vimeo.com/173787508 )
